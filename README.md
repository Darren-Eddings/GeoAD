# GeoAD
This application allows caretakers of alzheimers patients to track their patients through the use of a single app. While GeoAD is not ready for release on the Google Play store, it still has the basic funtionality to be a useful program. GeoAD uses geofences to notify a caretaker when their patient leaves their home. This app is used to help prevent wandering, which is common in alzheimers patients.

Currently, users can login as either a patient or a caretaker, with the expectation that patients will have their caretakers help when setting up an accout. After logging in as a patient, users are able to call their caretaker without having to remember the number, call emergency services, and view their existing geofences. Passively, the app will send the patient a notification when the boarder of their existing geofence is breached.

Logging in as a caretaker, you have access to a list of patients. Once you select which patient you would like to interact with you can view patient info and add multiple geofences.
